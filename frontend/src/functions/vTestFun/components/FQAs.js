      <p>
        An E chart (also known as a tumbling E chart) is an ophthalmological
        chart that is used to assess a patient’s vision. The chart is especially
        useful for patients who are unable to read the alphabet – for example,
        small children and also in cases where patients don’t speak English. It
        works on the same principle as Snellen’s distant vision chart.

      <h2 className="secondary-heading">What is different about the Tumbling E Eye Test?</h2>
      <p>
        Patients are asked to identify which direction the ‘fingers’ of the
        letter E are pointing rather than reading out a variety of letters. The
        tumbling letter E is used in replacement of the whole alphabet. Get in
        touch with us today to book your employees in for a Tumbling E Eye test
        or if you have any questions.
